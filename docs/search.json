After completing the tasks, participants were asked to complete two questionnaires, the Raw NASA Task Load Index (RTLX - Hart & Staveland, 1988; Hart 2006) and the System Usability Scale (Brooke 1996).\nThe RTLX is a 6 item, 21 point questionnaire on which people are asked to rate the subjective workload of a task across dimensions including mental demand, physical demand, temporal demand, performance, effort and frustration.The scale ranges from a minimum total score of 0 to a maximum of 126.\nThe SUS is a 10 item 5 point Likert scale questionnaire (ranging from 0 to 4) measuring the perceived usability of a computer system. The scale ranges from a minimum total score of 0 to a maximum total score of 100, as scores are summed and then multiplied by 2.5."
